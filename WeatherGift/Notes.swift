//struct gives initializer by default, classes create objects. If the class does not have all the variables initialized, you have to initialize all of them for the class to work. Use the INIT function to initialize everything.
//INSTANCE - object is an instance of a class

//SETVIEWCONTROLLERS
///Going to want an array of elements at first
///Pass an array of 1 viewcontroller representing one page
///Create a new viewController, and then set that up, so pass in the page value as 0
